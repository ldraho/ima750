  <h2>Sept 29</h2>
  <h3>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin, 1935.</h3>
   
</p>This reading is a lot to make sense of.</p>
   
  <h2>Oct 6</h2>
  <h3>As We May Think, by Vannevar Bush, published in The Atlantic Monthly, 1945.</h3>
    
  </p>It was fascinating to read what would be the origins around the concept of the world wide web, or what was sometimes called in the early years (e.g. the 90s)  the 'information super highway. What struck me most was how his intentions seemed so noble and logical. Why not 'link' all relatable or relevant information together for the sake of learning, inventions, and retention of valuable information. But here we are, 80 years later, and the information system of the internet is in many ways working against us. It is full of misinformation, explotative content, and useless AI slop.</p> 
    
  </p>As we are moving into the next phase of digital technology with AI, the 'links' to pages where we sort through information are now summarized through AI. Not only do we not have to remember anything, we also don't have to process the information. While the internet and the digital age have yielded positives, I wonder if Vannevar gave thought to the negative potential of the memex machine. As we ponder the impact of AI, so much attention has been paid to its anticipated downsides. It seems we may have learned our lesson - whatever is helpful can also be harmful.</p>

    <h2>Oct 14</h2>
  <h3>Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1970.</h3>
    
</p>If only Debord could see society in the digital age. "The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people mediated by images.” This argument takes on new meaning in the digital age where we are the consumers and makers of media. During the time when he would have written Society of the Spectacle, the consumer was influenced by the images that were created and shared largely by commerce - advertising, television, movies, and magazines. That a way of relating to each other, not through lived experience, but mediated through the image. But now there is shift in power and access. If we consider the social media platforms to be openely accessible, then we are now creating our own images of reality. The concept is the same - that we relate to each other via images - but the fact that we are makers in advancing these perceptions is different from Debord's era. The 'people' create new realties, norms, expectations, standards of beauty, entertainment, cultural trends, etc.</p>
  
    <p>His idea that the real consumer becomes a consumer of illusions, buying not use-value but the symbolic promise of satisfaction, is relevant today, but we are now active participants in meaning-making. But this 'meaning' can be entirely fictional as our online worlds are curated at best, and utterly fictionalized at worst via influencer culture or political agenda-advancing content. Now that our 'real worlds' and 'digital worlds' have become blurred, we are at greater risk of illusion. It is the spectacle on steriods. We no longer know what is real. But, at least we have access to the audiences. We can be the  makers of new realities. We are no longer passive victims of mass consumerism and a capitalist world order. At least some of us are now the economic makers.</p>

  <h3>Constituents of the Theory of Media by Hans Magnus Enzenberger, 1970</h3>
    
</p>Being able to participate and control the media seems to be a central part of Enzenberger’s essay. I do agree with the idea that true liberation depends not on hardware alone but on collective organization and self-determined use of media. But at the same time a lot of ‘action’ happens in real life. Events are created that are documented on social media, but ‘legitimized’ on mainstream media. I’m thinking of the Black Lives Matter protests, more recently No Kings Day, and several years ago, the Occupy Wall Street movement.</p>

<p>While mainstream capitalist systems control both the medium and the message, movements seem to accelerate when they are covered by these types of media. The way the events or movement is presented may have a slant/agenda, but it is given visibility nonetheless. Sort of like ‘even bad PR is good PR’.</p>

<p>Channels that are easily accessible and allow for a sense of dialogue - like social media - give agency to the masses/consumer. But it is not fully egalitarian. Some are better ‘performers’ and understand the platforms, and therefore gain incredible popularity, like we see with Zohran Mamdami and Trump. There is a sense of accessibility to these people. But it is a false sense.</p>

<p>I am not sure I agree that new media can dissolve hierarchies between producers and consumers, between art and everyday life, and that their emancipatory power lies in their ability to mobilize, connect, and educate collectively. These arguments seem too simplistic and have not accounted for the toxic role of technology, e.g. bots, algorithms, AI slop, bad actors, etc. With self-production, there still needs to be a way of managing misinformation. Although I am not sure how gatekeeping comes into play, as that is problematic.</p>

  <h3>Cyborg Manifesto, by Donna Haraway</h3>
    <p>A complicated and highly theoretical reading. But I did like when she begins to discuss the concept of 'homework'. Haraway takes issue with Marxist and socialist-feminist theory and finds it to be monolothic and not inclusive, and argues for a more expansive approach one without gender boundaries. The idea of rethinking the concept of production and woman's role in the home and in the working world in a digital age made sense. Factory workers, low page office jobs, women as head of households, disconnected social ties, feminization of poverty, tech-related jobs, and biotechnology are part of a new world order. I did agree that the concept of uniting by affinity vs. identity makes sense as identity is a heterogeneous experience with the world.</p>

  <h3>Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance, Chapter 2 of The Electronic Disturbances, 1994 </h3>
  
<p> This reading, which looked at the changing rules of cultural and political resistance, highlighting the difference between sedentary and nomadic power, mentions that grand architecture of Churches reflected the Church's power. This made me think about the new JP Morgan building at 270 Park Ave. Review of the building have said it is not a 'quiet building' that blends into the streetscape or skyline. Rather, its grand steel strcutures jutting out and visible rather than hidden behind walls, evoke strength and dominance, and reinforce the bank's power.  

I liked this article and was suprised to see that the book had been written in 1994. Digital media and nomadic power is the currency of power today - obviously way more so than 30 years ago. It's an unseeable and global power with no fixed location, but with interconnected but disolocated labor sources (programmer across the US, call centers in India, manufacturers in China, etc.). Nomadic power today seems far more powerful than in 1994. In thinking about 'disturbances' as an act of resistance,  a few recent examples came to mind: campaign memes (e.g. #blacklivesmatter, #metoo; cancel culture; coordinated consumer resistance (mass cancelling of Uber subscriptions after fall out from the toxic CEO Travis Kalanick, leading to his firing; more recenlty cancelling of Disney+ subscriptions over the push back around Jimmy Kimmel's show; and boycotting online purchasing - no shopping days.) While these moments in time don't seem to lead to lasting change, they remind us of the power of collective online action as an act of resistance. But invisible power - alogrithms that guide what we see/consume; inherent bias baked into AI coding, bots, etc. - is harder to push back against. But awareness is the first step before action. And I think we are in an awareness building stage - we know there is a problem but don't yet know how to solve it. </p>

  <h3>Digital Affordances, by Janet Murray, 1997; 2016</h3>
<p>She talks about encyclopedic affordance, which I took to mean the consumer of the media (e.g. the audience) builds on the content to dissect and interpret it; create backstories such a fanbased storytelling; and discuss and debate the story. All this adds up to additional content. I reminds me of the Meow Wolf House immersive art installation in Sante Fe. The participant has to create meaning, but apparently there are online forums where people to discuss the meanings, and in doing so, create another 'reality' or story. The idea of co-creating, building new meaning or intepreting an event can lead to other content. I am thiking of content/memes that popped up on recent events - something as silly as the couple being outed for an affair at the Cold Play concert to the robbery at the Louvre and the killing of the United Healthcare CEO. I am not sure what all this new content creation does, but to some extent it is co-creation and interpretation of events that is not governed by the media corporation.</p>

  <h3>Lo and Behold, by Werner Herzog, 2016</h3>
<p>One of the things that struck me the most about looking back at the history of the internet is that it was built on a foundation that the original users all knew each other. What that meant, as noted in the documentary, was that it was constructed on a foundation of trust since all users knew each other, and thus had an inherent level of accountability. It was not built with the initial goal of assuming protections for users and punishing bad actors. With this mind, I didn't see evidence in the film that suggests lessons were learend as we are now moving into the AI era. 
  
Another perspective that came through toward the end of the film, was expressed by one of the scientists who said that while it hard to imagine in the present that humans could have their emotional neeeds met by robots or AI companions, who is to say that this may be perfectly acceptable in the future. The idea that technology is driving human adaption shows a level of hubris and lack of ethics and morality among the scientific community. To what end are we needing all this technology to stand in for human experiences. I appreciated the documentary's neutral point of view and a willingness to explore and understand the past, present and future of technology. 

The documentary offered up a positive take on robots and machine learning - as one scientist pointed out that lessons learned from self-driving cars can be applied to every single car, now and in the future. Whereas, a lesson learned by an individual can not scale past that one person. True. But, who is asking the questions about the consequences of accepting that human connections -- including the ability to experience empathy -- can be replaced by a robot. This feels like an example of unchecked 'nomadic power', an idea introduced in 'Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance'. The power is concentrated in the makers and owners of tech companies, without any regulations or examination of the impact of these new technologies. </p>

  <h3>10 Print Chr$205.5+rnd1: Goto 10, multiple authors, 2012</h3>
<p>My main take-away from the introduction chapter was that code is not neutral. It is exists within a historical, cultural, and political context. The book notes "there is a fundamental relationship between the formal workings of code and hte cultural implications and receptions of that code." And also "code is understandable" and "code is a cultural resource, not trivial and only instrumental, but bound up in social change, aesthetic projects, and the relationship of people to computers." I think given that we live in an increasingly tech-first culture and with the mystery of AI and obscure technologies such as block chain, put the power of language and communication into those who write and use these code languages. With AI, there has been criticism that it is programmed on a set of cutlural values that are determined by a select group of people. Famously, the prompt 'show me a person' would show us a white person. But the book also explores that code has implications. In this moment, as we interface with the digital world more and more, the list of implications seems endless, and probably problematic. What we watch and eat, where we go, who we interact with, what we learn, and what we buy are all influenced by code. Will it be possible to live in a code unmediated world?</p>

  <h3>Glitch Feminism: Nope, A Manifesto, by Legacy Russell [I READ THE WRONG CHAPTER, BUT I READ THE INTRO AND THE CITARELLA PIECE]</h3>
<p>I like the term 'glitch' feminism and the idea of giving space to a boundariless identity. The idea of exploring alternate identities in the digital world, for me, brought into focus the limits of binary genders. She writes 'glitch is about claiming our right to complexity, to range, within and beyond the proverbial margins.' On her website, she says "Glitch Feminism, however, embraces the causality of “error”, and turns the gloomy implication of glitch on its ear by acknowledging that an error in a social system that has already been disturbed by economic, racial, social, sexual, and cultural stratification and the imperialist wrecking-ball of globalization—processes that continue to enact violence on all bodies—may not, in fact, be an error at all, but rather a much-needed erratum. This glitch is a correction to the “machine”, and, in turn, a positive departure." Dominant digital platforms - social media, google - still mirror the external world as she writes 'glitched bodies are not considered in the process of programming new creative technologies' going on to recognize the deeply flawwed use Google's image-recognition. But still, the idea of using technology as a place of disruption and to say 'nope' to imposed norms around gender is empowering.

As for the Citarella piece, I liked the three reasons for radicalization: lack of economic opportunity; social isolation; excessive content. </p>

  <h3>Does Digital Culture Want to be Free: Artists Rethinking the Blockchain, by Rachel O'Dwyer</h3>
<p>I very much agreed with O'Dwyere in her assessment that while new platforms for tracking copyright infringement and offering new forms of payment contracts, that overall these platforms exist to monetize artist content. The plaforms that she mentioned -  Ascribe, Monograph and Ujo - exist to make money. While I don't know much about each them, typically these platforms have business models and investors. 

  The idea of generating data insights - likes, shares, consumer preferences and demographics - to enable artists to 'market' themselves for brand deals, etc. could lead artists/producers to create content that appeals to the market. Netflix can gain tremendous insight into consumer preferneces in order to fund content that the market wants. But this can lead to imitation art vs. original ideas. Finding ways for artists to make money without intermediatries is valid, but it would work best if if was truly a system where the artist was directly selling to the consumer. Once you introduce a 'platform' with a business interest, like O'Dwyer says, 'digital culture wants to be free in the world of blockchains, not because the blockchain is a democratic tool that will abolish the exploitation of artists by big business, but because stronger property rights and legalities are no longer where the money is at. </p>
